"Card Management is key. You have a limited hand size (e.g., six cards) and a cap on total cards in play (hand + slots). You can't exceed this limit. Click the deck to draw cards until your hand is full. To make space, drag unwanted cards to the trash. At the end of each round, all cards-whether in your hand or in play-are refreshed, letting you keep building your strategy.";

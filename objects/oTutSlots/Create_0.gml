"At the start of each turn, you roll three six-sided die, each linked to one of three Action Slots (e.g., Die 1 corresponds to Slot 1). There are two slot types: Action Slots, which hold only Action Cards, and one Special Slot, which can hold either Dice Cards or Kaos Cards. You can play only one card in the Special Slot per turn, making timing and choice a key part of your strategy.";

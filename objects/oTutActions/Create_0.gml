"Action Cards allow you to execute powerful moves to gain an advantage during the game. Use them to attack, heal, or defend. Each Action Card has a specific range (e.g., 1-6). At the end of your turn, the card rolls a number within its range and adds it to the die in the same slot. The sum determines the final strength of the card's effect.";

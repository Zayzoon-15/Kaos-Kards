"When it's time to fight, all the cards in your slots activate. Kaos Cards go first, but turn order is random, so you might go first or last. After that, your Action Cards play in order: Slot 1, then Slot 2, then Slot 3. Each card's effect, whether it's an attack, heal, or defense, resolves in that sequence. Drop your enemy's health to zero to win, so make every move count!";
